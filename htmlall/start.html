                <h2>Pencile Sketch</h2>
                <p>Pencil drawing, drawing executed with an instrument composed of graphite enclosed in a wood casing
                    and intended either as a sketch for a more elaborate work in another medium, an exercise in visual
                    expression, or a finished work.The cylindrical graphite pencil, because of its usefulness in easily
                    producing linear gray-black strokes, became the successor of the older, metallic drawing stylus,
                    with which late medieval and Renaissance artists and tradesmen sketched or wrote on paper,
                    parchment, or wood.Although graphite was mined in the 16th century, the use by artists of pieces of
                    natural graphite, inserted in a porte-crayon (“pencil holder”), is not known before the 17th
                    century. Then minor graphite details were included in sketches, notably in landscape renderings by
                    Dutch artists. During that century and most of the 18th, graphite was used to make preliminary
                    sketch lines for drawings to be completed in other media, but drawings completely finished with
                    graphite were rare.
                    Although pencil drawings were much less commonly produced by artists of those centuries than
                    sketches in chalks, charcoal, and pen and ink, the use of graphite gradually increased among
                    painters, miniaturists, architects, and designers. By the late 18th century, an ancestor of the
                    modern pencil was constructed in the form of a rod of natural graphite fitted into a hollow cylinder
                    of wood. Not until 1795, however, did the French inventor Nicolas-Jacques Conté devise a method of
                    producing pencil rods from mixtures of graphite and clays, a true prototype of the modern graphite
                    pencil. Conté’s technical improvement made possible the production of fine pencils the strokes of
                    which could be controlled, varying from type to type in softness and hardness, darkness and
                    lightness. These excellent quality graphite pencils encouraged wider use by 19th-century artists,
                    and pencil drawing became commonly used for studies and preliminary sketches. The graphite pencil
                    could be used on almost any type of drawing surface, a fact that helped make it indispensable in the
                    artist’s studio.
                    Although graphite pencils provided a substantial range of light–dark effects and the opportunity for
                    tonal modeling, the greatest masters of pencil drawing always kept the elements of a simple
                    linearism or limited shading that were appropriate to pencil drawing. This concept of pencil drawing
                    contrasted with that sometimes employed in the 18th and 19th centuries in which extensive tonal
                    modeling of three-dimensional forms and elaborate effects of light and shade were produced by
                    artists and miniaturists by rubbing the soft graphite particles with a stump, a tightly rolled piece
                    of soft paper or chamois.

                <h2>Oil Pastel</h2>
                <p>A pastel (UK: /ˈpæstəl/, US: /pæˈstɛl/) is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of
                    powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are similar to those used to produce
                    some other colored visual arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low
                    saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other
                    process.[1] Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance, and gained considerable
                    popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium.
                    An artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). Pastel
                    used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective it means pale in color.The
                    modern oil pastel was not developed until the 20th century, but the wax based medium has historical
                    roots that date back thousands of years. According to the Oil Pastels Society, oil pastels are
                    related to melted wax painting. Instead of painting with dry wax, the wax was melted and used as a
                    traditional paint.This historic method of wax painting is called encaustics and is approximately
                    2,000 years old. In 1921, the traditional oil pastel was developed by an artist named Yamamoto. The
                    crayon he developed drew on the wax painting method and combined the softness and smooth texture of
                    a crayon with the bright colours of the common pastel. Although the final product was produced for
                    children, famous artists became inspired by the use of oil pastels.</p>
